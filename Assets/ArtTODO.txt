Art stuff that we need
-Repeatable ladder (so that they can be different lengths)
-Elevator 
-Rock platforms
-wood platforms
-Solar panel (doesn't have to look like an actual solar panel, just unique to other platforms)
-A blank note template (the pickupable notes that are throughout the game)
-A repeatable magic beam (for the projectile to knock out lights)
-A logo for the main menu
- A little skeleton for the opening of the game
- an idle animation for the character
- a sprite of him with his arms out in front (like he's using the force)
- a light sprite
- a breakable light sprite (it doesn't matter what the difference is as long as it is distinguishable)
- simple animation a light breaking

EXTRA STUFF - these aren't really important, more like cool polish for the game
- A cool magic ball for the projectile
