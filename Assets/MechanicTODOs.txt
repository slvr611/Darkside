LIGHT EXPLANATION
---------------------
The way the light works is that it has an array of 3d colliders and gets the 
position of each of the vertices and shoots rays slighty to the left and right
(the offset float). And then takes all of those hit points and creates a triangle fan.
(a bunch of triangles where all of them share a center point: the position of the light source)
The problem with the current mirror implementation is that because the mirror isn't ALWAYS 
there from the start, it never makes it into to that array of colliders that the raycasts 
shoot at. So there doesn't seem to be a reliable way to check if light is hitting the mirror.
